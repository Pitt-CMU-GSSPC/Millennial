  about: "Emily Eikey grew up outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and she received her B.S. in
Chemistry from Allegheny College in 2016. During her undergraduate career, she conducted
research in multiple areas. At Allegheny College, she studied the thermodynamics of RNA
hairpins under the supervision of Professor Martin Serra. She also participated in two
summer research experiences, one at the Pennsylvania State University studying metal-lipid
interactions under the advisement of Professor Paul Cremer and another at Duquesne
University using computational tools to optimize metal complexes under the direction of
Professor Jeffrey Evanseck. After exploring many areas of chemistry, Emily decided to
complete her graduate work in the field of nanomaterials. Currently, she is a fourth year NSF
Graduate Research Fellow in Professor Jill Millstone’s group. Her interests lie in re-imagining
the richness and diversity inherent in defining, controlling, and leveraging material
composition and atom position in ternary metal chalcogenide nanoparticles and actively
collaborates with an electron microscopist at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is the
Millstone laboratory manager, in charge of ordering supplies, maintaining finances, and
ensuring the safety of lab members. Emily enjoys spending time with family and friends,
attending concerts, and taking her pup Maci for walks."

  about: "Paige Moncure is from Wilmington, Delaware and received her undergraduate degree from
the University of Pittsburgh. She conducted undergraduate research in Professor Jill
Millstone’s lab exploring size and shape control of copper chalcogenide nanoparticles. She
decided to stay at the University of Pittsburgh for her Ph.D. and initiated a collaboration
between Professors Jill Millstone and Jennifer Laaser. She is in her third year, and her
current research uses the interferometric scattering microscope she built in Professor
Laaser’s lab to study material dynamics at the nanoscale. Specifically, she is interested in
colloidal nanoparticle nucleation kinetics and confined diffusion of nanoparticles in hydrogels.
Paige is a volunteer at the Carnegie Science Center, helping with the various scientific
outreach events they host. Outside of the lab, Paige enjoys participating in triathlons, hiking,
going to operas with her boyfriend, and playing with her dogs, Molly and Hazel."

  about: "Xing Yee Gan grew up in Malaysia and came to the U.S. in 2010 where she went to
University of Washington in Seattle for her undergraduate education. She is currently a fifth
year Ph.D. student in Professor Jill Millstone’s group. Her current research focuses on using
degenerately-doped semiconductor nanoparticles as a class of cost-effective, plasmonic
alternatives for sensing applications as well as light-driven chemical reactions. Xing Yee
currently leads a multi- departmental and university collaboration funded by the Defense
Threat Reduction Agency, focusing on the development of multifunctional materials for
chemical weapon sensing and decontamination. She also initiated a collaboration with a
graduate student from the University of Minnesota when she attended a conference in Hong
Kong as a second year, and they successfully published a joint paper in 2019. Xing Yee was
one of the organizers and presiders for a graduate student organized symposium in the
Analytical Chemistry division in the ACS Fall 2018 Meeting in Boston. She currently serves
as a co-chair for the Colloidal Semiconductor Nanocrystals Gordon Research Seminar 2020
to be held in Switzerland."

  email: "mic132@pitt.edu"
  about: "Michael Cowan grew up in a small town in upstate New York before completing his B.S. in
Chemistry at Binghamton University. While there, he studied photocatalytic nanomaterials
under the guidance of Professor Wayne Jones Jr. After graduating in 2015, Michael moved
on to complete his M.Eng. in Chemical Engineering from the University at Buffalo where his
research focus shifted towards the use of computational tools. Under the direction of
Professor Edward Furlani, he collaborated with local industry to model the flow of an
industrial clay extrusion process. The work led to employment in 2016, where Michael spent
his time split between studying clay extrusion and co-developing a software plugin for the
company. Michael returned to school in 2017 at the University of Pittsburgh. He is currently a
third year Ph.D. Chemical Engineering student under the advisement of Professor Giannis
Mpourmpakis. In his current work, he utilizes Density Functional Theory
calculations to develop structure-property relationships for
ligand-protected metal nanoparticles. He served as the 2018-2019 Vice President of the Pitt
Chemical Engineering Graduate Student Association – co-organizing volunteering and social
events. Michael enjoys working on personal coding projects, running, and playing guitar."

  about: "Eric Lopato was raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and obtained a B.S. in Chemistry from
St. John’s University in New York City. He started conducting inorganic chemistry research
under the supervision of Professor Richard Rosso producing novel N-heterocyclic carbene
ligands for ruthenium-based catalysts. During a summer at the Washington State University
Laboratory for Atmospheric Research, he worked with Professor Brian Lamb on atmospheric
chemical modeling involved in development of AIRPACT-5. Currently, he is a second year
graduate student pursuing his Ph.D. in Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University under the
advisement of Professor Stefan Bernhard. His current research focuses on mass parallelized
screening of photocatalytic systems for the generation of fuels and energy storage materials
from abundant materials or industrial waste products. In this work, Eric has worked in
collaborations within chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science and engineering,
computer science, and machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University as well as with the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh."
