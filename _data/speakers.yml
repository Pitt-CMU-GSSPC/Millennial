  bio: "<b>Omar K. Farha</b> is an associate professor of chemistry at Northwestern University, president of NuMat Technologies, and Associate Editor for ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces. His current research spans diverse areas of chemistry and materials science ranging from energy to defense related challenges.  Specifically, his research focuses on the rational design of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for applications sensing, catalysis, storage, separations and water purification. His research accomplishments have been recognized by several awards and honors including Kuwait Prize, Japanese Society of Coordination Chemistry “International award for creative work”; the Royal Society of Chemistry “Environment, Sustainability and Energy Division Early Career” Award; the American Chemical society “The Satinder Ahuja Award for Young Investigators in Separation Science; and an award established by the Department of Chemistry at Northwestern University in his honor: the Omar Farha Award for Research Leadership “awarded for stewardship, cooperation and leadership in the finest pursuit of research in chemistry” and given annually to an outstanding research scientist working in the department. Prof. Farha has more than 430 peer-reviewed publications, holds 16 patents,  47,000 citation and h-index of 107 (google Scholar), and has been named a “Highly Cited Researcher” in 2014 to 2019. Omar is the co-founder of NuMat Technologies, the first company to commercialized an engineered system level product enabled by Metal-Organic Framework Materials."

  bio:
    - "<b>Teri W. Odom</b> is Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry and Chair of the Chemistry Department at Northwestern University. She is an expert in designing structured nanoscale materials that exhibit extraordinary size and shape-dependent optical properties. Odom has pioneered a suite of multi-scale nanofabrication tools that have resulted in plasmon-based nanoscale lasers that exhibit tunable color, flat optics that can manipulate light at the nanoscale and beat the diffraction limit, and hierarchical substrates that show controlled wetting and super-hydrophobicity. She has also invented a class of biological nanoconstructs that are facilitating unique insight into nanoparticle-cell interactions and that show superior imaging and therapeutic properties because of their gold nanostar shape."
    - "Odom is a Fellow of the Materials Research Society (MRS), the American Chemical Society (ACS), the American Physical Society (APS), the Optical Society of America (OSA), the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), and is an OSA Senior Member. She has received numerous other honors and awards, including the ACS National Award in Surface Science; a Research Corporation TREE Award; a U.S. Department of Defense Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship; the Associated Student Government Faculty Honor Roll; the Carol Tyler Award from the International Precious Metals Institute; a Blavatnik Young Scientist Finalist in Chemistry and Physical Sciences and Engineering; a Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Fellowship at Harvard University; the ACS Akron Section Award; an National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Pioneer Award; the MRS Outstanding Young Investigator Award; the National Fresenius Award from Phi Lambda Upsilon and the ACS; the Rohm and Haas New Faculty Award; an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship; a DuPont Young Investigator Grant; a NSF CAREER Award; the ExxonMobil Solid State Chemistry Faculty Fellowship; and a David and Lucile Packard Fellowship in Science and Engineering. Odom was founding Chair of the Noble Metal Nanoparticles Gordon Research Conference (2010) and founding Vice-Chair of Lasers in Micro, Nano, Bio Systems (2018). She is on the Editorial Advisory Boards of ACS Nano, Materials Horizons, ChemNanoMat, and Bioconjugate Chemistry. She was founding Associate Editor for Chemical Science (2009-2013), founding Executive Editor of ACS Photonics (2013 - 2019), and is currently Editor-in-Chief of Nano Letters. Odom’s <a href='http://axial.acs.org/2018/02/26/teri-odom-discovery/'>Personal Story of Discovery</a> was featured by ACS Publications."
